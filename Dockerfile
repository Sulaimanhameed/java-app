# Multi-stage Dockerfile for Java Spring Boot application

# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Maven wrapper and pom.xml first for better layer caching
COPY pom.xml .
COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Make Maven wrapper executable
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw

# Download dependencies (this layer will be cached if pom.xml doesn't change)
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the application
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -B

# Stage 2: Runtime stage

# Install curl for health checks (optional)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create non-root user for security
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy JAR from build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Change ownership to non-root user
RUN chown appuser:appuser app.jar

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose port (adjust if your app uses different port)
EXPOSE 8080

# Add health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1
